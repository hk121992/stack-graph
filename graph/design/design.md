when-to-use: A work-item's intent is aligned and you need to resolve its design by outcome before specify/plan/build — frame the solution, vet it with the lens panel over the design doc, and (for an experience-bearing item) author or refine its experience-contract.

# `target: doc` — identical to how `review` consumes the same reference with `target: diff`. The
# finding contract (findings-schema / severity-scale / confidence-anchors) is imported and passed
# into each lens's spawn prompt (the lens-consumer invariant). The **product-lens** composes into
# `@design` from the PM side and is built separately (PM pack) — its strategy-check seam is left in
# prose with NO edge (F7). The **carrier** is read via bindings and the **experience-contract** via
# its external reference; design writes the design doc / touchpoints / contract to harness surfaces
# and carries NO carrier write-edge (the projected state model — `current_stage` is projected from

  - outcome: The solution is checked against value-prop / target-user AND code-correctness / feasibility at the item altitude (the four risks at item scope), so item-level risks surface at design, not at build.
    metric: share of design sessions where the lens family + the product-lens surfaced ≥1 actioned finding; risks left unexamined at design that bit at build.
    earns-keep: design-stage findings measurably displace later build/review findings; a design pass that routinely surfaces nothing real is a cut/tune signal.
  - outcome: A design doc carrying an explicit Spec touchpoints table is produced, ready for specify.
    metric: share of design sessions producing a touchpoints table; touchpoints specify later finds missing.
    earns-keep: specify rarely has to reconstruct touchpoints from scratch.
  - outcome: For an experience-bearing item, the experience-contract is authored or refined at design, not discovered missing or stale at verify.
    metric: share of experience-bearing items whose contract was authored/refined at design vs discovered missing/stale when simulate-users runs at verify.
    earns-keep: simulate-users rarely runs against a missing or stale contract.

# Design

Run the **shared product + engineering/design front** for a work-item. This is where the product
lens and the code/design lenses converge over the **same carrier and the same
experience-contract** to resolve the item's load-bearing design questions **by intended outcome** —
before specify, plan, and build. You own **the design conversation, the lens dispatch over the
design doc, operator interaction, and the resolution to a design doc**. You do **not** perform any
lens dimension yourself (the lens agents own that) and you do **not** decide product strategy
yourself (the product-lens owns that — see *The product-strategy seam*).

You hold the operator in the loop: design is collaborative by nature, and on a novel problem it can
take rounds. Your deliverable is a **design doc with an explicit Spec touchpoints table**, ready
for `specify` — and, when the item bears an experience, an **authored or refined
experience-contract**.

## When to invoke

Invoke when a work-item's intent is aligned (typically handed forward by `align-context`) and its
design must be resolved before it can be specified, planned, and built. The operator may pass a
**mode token** (`lightweight` / `standard` / `deep` / `experience`), the **carrier** (the roadmap
item / work-item), and an intent or design-question summary. Default to `standard` when no mode is
given. Reach for `experience` (in addition to the others) whenever the item bears a user-facing
experience whose contract must be authored or refined here.

## What you read, and what you must not write

Read for context; write only to harness surfaces.

- **The carrier** — read it via bindings for its `lifecycle_state`, prior `transition_history`, the
  objective it serves, and any parent/child decomposition. It is a harness surface, not a node, and
  you hold no edge to it.
- **The experience-contract** — for an experience-bearing item, read the harness's current contract
  through your `experience-contract` reference (external, on-demand); the overlay binds it to this
  product's contract.
- **The handbook + decisions** — read settled intent and rationale through your `handbook`
  reference (external, on-demand); navigate pages at the step of need.

You **do not write the carrier.** You write the design doc, the touchpoints, and the contract to
**harness surfaces** (via bindings) — never to the carrier itself. Completing this stage is the
signal the projection/curator picks up to advance the carrier's `current_stage`; it is projected
from the observed traversal, not written by you. Advancing the carrier's `lifecycle_state` and
recording a `gate_decision` are **PM / operator** decisions at a gate — not design's job.

## Phase 1 — Frame the design question

1. Read the carrier and the aligned intent. State the item's **load-bearing design questions** —
   the decisions that, left unresolved, would force rework at specify/plan/build.
2. Fill any context gaps by **invoking `explore`** (scoped, read-only): pass it a scope/mode
   selector (`repo` / `learnings` / `framework-docs` / `web` / `best-practices`), the target
   question, and a scope summary. Consume its distilled digest; do not re-explore ground
   `align-context` already covered — the front gathers context once.
3. Resolve each design question **by intended outcome** — reason from what the item is meant to
   achieve to the design decision, not from implementation convenience. Surface assumptions and
   take them to the operator where the question is novel or contested.

## Phase 2 — Vet the design with the lens panel

Once the design is framed enough to examine, **dispatch the lens family over the design doc** by
**following the `lens-dispatch` reference** with `target: doc`. The reference gives you lens
selection, the fan-out, and the deterministic merge / dedup / corroborate / confidence-gate /
severity-route reduction.

- Run the lenses **strategy-first, then parallel**: lead with the design-altitude lenses, then fan
  the remaining active lenses out in parallel.
- As you fan out, pass each lens its own spawn prompt carrying the **target** (`doc`) and the
  design doc's contents, the **scope-rules** and intent summary, and the **finding contract** — the
  finding schema, severity scale, and confidence anchors, which you hold from your imported
  references — so every lens emits to the same contract.
- **You do not direct-invoke the lenses.** They declare `composes-into @design` from their own
  side; you reach them only through the dispatch reference (exactly as `review` reaches them with
  `target: diff`). Each lens returns the compact finding tier; the dispatch reduces those returns
  to one ranked, routed finding set.

Surface the ranked findings and the soft buckets to the operator, and **action them in-session** —
fold the actioned findings back into the design before it advances. A finding that names an
item-altitude risk (the four risks at item scope) is the point of this phase: surface it here, not
at build.

## The product-strategy seam

The design front also checks the solution against **product strategy** — *is this the right
problem? does it serve the value proposition and the target user? which objective does it serve?* —
but **you do not perform that check yourself.** It is delivered by the **product-lens**, a separate
skill (the PM pack) that **composes into the `@design` front from the product-management side**.
Treat it as a peer that joins this front: where it is present in the harness, the strategy check
runs alongside your lens dispatch and its findings action into the same design doc. This node holds
**no edge** to the product-lens — it is built separately and composes in from its own side; name
the seam, leave the strategy judgement to it.

## Phase 3 — Author the design doc + touchpoints

Produce the **design doc** to a harness surface:

- Record the **resolved design decisions** — each load-bearing question and the outcome-driven
  decision that settles it.
- Carry an explicit **Spec touchpoints** table — for each touched spec area, the *spec doc*, the
  *section*, and the *relationship* (amend / add / supersede / reference). This table is what
  `specify` turns into the canonical amendment; produce it here so `specify` does not reconstruct
  it. (Touchpoints are inlined in the doc for now.)
- Fold in the actioned lens findings and any product-lens findings so the doc reflects the vetted
  design, not the first draft.

## Phase 4 — Author or refine the experience-contract (experience-bearing items)

For an experience-bearing item, **author or refine the experience-contract** to the harness surface
(via bindings), conforming to the `experience-contract-schema` you hold (read it on-demand for the
shape). Read the harness's current contract through your `experience-contract` reference, then write
the four parts plus the evidence state:

- **Session-shape invariants (UX)** — the checkable properties every session must hold, ranked by
  importance.
- **Failure modes (UX)** — the named, labelled ways the experience is known to break, each
  recognisable with one-line evidence.
- **AX budgets** — the cost envelope to the outcome: tokens-to-outcome, latency / inference-steps,
  and acceptable tool-path breadth, set per-scenario where they differ.
- **Intended tool-path** — the path the product intends the agent to take through its surface
  (which tools/nodes, in what rough order), so observed divergence reads as friction.
- **Evidence state** — mark each invariant / failure-mode / budget `assumed` / `tested` /
  `confirmed`, so the contract matures with the product.

This is the **design-time end of the experience thread**: the contract you author here is the same
artefact `simulate-users` grades against at verify. Authoring or refining it now is what keeps
`simulate-users` from running against a missing or stale contract. You author the **shape and
content discipline**; the harness fills its own invariants, failure modes, budgets, and path.

## Modes

Render as branches of this one skill. Every mode reads the carrier, resolves the design by outcome,
and writes only to harness surfaces; the differences are in depth, operator rounds, and which work
runs.

### lightweight

A known, small item. Resolve the design questions **inline** (thin or no `explore`), produce a
**light design doc** with its touchpoints, and run **always-on doc lenses only** through the
dispatch (no conditional/adversarial lenses). One-pass operator interaction.

### standard (default)

`explore` for context gaps; resolve the design questions by outcome; **dispatch the lens family
over the doc strategy-first then parallel**; author the design doc + the Spec touchpoints table.
The default front pass.

### deep

A novel or contested item. **Multiple operator rounds**, surfacing and testing assumptions; run the
dispatch with the **adversarial lens on** (and any other conditional lenses the change triggers).
Use when the design carries real uncertainty or blast radius.

### experience

The thread-spanning branch. In addition to resolving the design, **author or refine the
experience-contract** for an experience-bearing item (Phase 4) — UX invariants + failure modes + AX
budgets + intended tool-path, to the harness surface, conforming to the schema. Combine with
`standard` / `deep` as the item's design complexity demands.

## Process seams (deferred edges)

- **← `align-context`** (`can-follow`, authored): design follows alignment; it consumes the aligned
  intent and the starting touchpoint set, and does not re-explore the same ground.
- **→ `specify`** (`precedes`, authored): design hands the design doc + touchpoints table to
  `specify`, which turns it into the canonical spec amendment.
- **→ `plan`** (deferred — F7): design precedes planning; the edge is authored once `plan` exists.
  Until then the flow holds in prose — a resolved design doc with touchpoints feeds the plan.

## Output

- A **design doc** on a harness surface, recording the outcome-driven design decisions and carrying
  an explicit **Spec touchpoints** table, ready for `specify`.
- The **ranked, routed lens findings** over that doc (from the dispatch), surfaced and actioned
  in-session, folded back into the doc.
- In `experience` mode: an **authored or refined experience-contract** on the harness surface,
  conforming to `experience-contract-schema`.
- **No carrier write.** Completing design is the signal the projection/curator picks up to advance
  `current_stage`; the lifecycle and gate decisions remain PM/operator calls.
