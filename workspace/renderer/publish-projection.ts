/**
 * publish-projection.ts
 * ---------------------
 * Projection snapshot publisher (A3b-5).
 *
 * Reads the local .stack-graph/events.jsonl event log and emits a SANITIZED
 * portal-projection.json keyed by the current git commit SHA.
 *
 * ASSUMED EVENT SCHEMA (documented here because the docs pin the fields but
 * leave a few optional ones implicit):
 *
 *   Every event is a JSON object on a single line (JSONL). Mandatory fields:
 *     ts            — ISO-8601 UTC timestamp  (e.g. "2026-06-02T10:00:00Z")
 *     session       — session identifier string
 *     kind          — "enter" | "exit" | "gate" | "traverse" | "dispatch-complete"
 *     node          — node id string  (present on enter/exit/gate; omit on traverse)
 *     carrier       — carrier id string, or null if no carrier is active
 *     carrier_kind  — "work-item" | "standalone-iu" | null  (instrumentation-preamble v0.2.0+)
 *     arc           — arc id string (e.g. "dev-sprint" | "incremental") | null  (preamble v0.2.0+)
 *
 *   THE PROJECTION TRIPLE-KEY: a carrier's current_stage keys by the FULL triple
 *     (carrier_id, carrier_kind, arc) — NOT carrier id alone. build/review/land are shared
 *     across the dev-sprint and incremental arcs, so keying by carrier id alone would let one
 *     arc's stage bleed into another's at a shared node (carrier-interface.md "The projection
 *     key"; 06-analytics). Legacy enter events missing carrier_kind or arc are EXCLUDED from
 *     the stage projection (degrade, never guess — matching the publisher's strictness posture).
 *
 *   Additional fields on "exit" events (from instrumentation-preamble.md):
 *     outcome  — short outcome label string (e.g. "intent-settled")
 *     gates    — array of gate strings (e.g. ["commit-to-build:pass"])
 *     metrics  — optional object of named trend measurements (e.g. {"benchmark.perf": 1234});
 *                only present on measurement-bearing exit events
 *
 *   "dispatch-complete" events (06-analytics; loop-runner): a STRUCTURAL subagent-completion
 *     event (carrier + outcome). After D69 the body emits NO token numbers on it — cost rides the
 *     hook usage events below — so the publisher only enforces the fabrication guard on its metrics.
 *
 *   HOOK usage events "unit-usage" / "session-usage" / "dispatch-usage" (D69 / #21):
 *     The ONLY source of token cost. Each carries a 6-component `token_usage` block (input, output,
 *     cache_creation_5m, cache_creation_1h, cache_read, total — the cache split preserved), a
 *     dominant `model`, a per-event `v` (version-gated), `cumulative`, and a `scope_id`
 *     (iu id / anonymised session / carrier id). Read by the closed USAGE_COMPONENT_KEYS allowlist;
 *     latest-per (kind, scope) for cumulative kinds. NEVER advances current_stage.
 *
 *   Additional fields on "traverse" events (from 06-analytics README):
 *     from, to — node ids (the edge traversed)
 *     arc      — arc id string, optional
 *
 *   Additional field used for AX data:
 *     ax       — optional object with aggregate metrics; only present on ax-bearing events
 *
 *   NOTE: the docs are silent on a dedicated "stage" field — a carrier's current_stage
 *   is derived as the node id of the latest "enter" event for that carrier. This is
 *   consistent with artefacts-design.md §5 ("current_stage = the latest stage event for
 *   that carrier") and instrumentation-preamble.md ("carrier tagging" section).
 *
 *   SANITIZATION CONTRACT: this script reads from each event only ts, kind, node, carrier,
 *   carrier_kind, arc (the last two validated against closed value allowlists), the ax aggregate
 *   object, the metrics measurement object (TREND_SERIES allowlist), the hook usage block
 *   (USAGE_COMPONENT_KEYS allowlist + a grammar-validated model + a version-gated `v`), and —
 *   for conformance only — a COUNT of the closed-allowlist experience-contract gate token (never
 *   the gate string itself). A raw session id is NEVER echoed (session-usage scope is anonymised to
 *   `sess-<n>`). It never reads, copies, or echoes:
 *     - outcome strings (may reflect private content)
 *     - free-text gate names (only the closed `experience-contract:<pass|fail>` token is
 *       inspected, and only its pass/fail tally is surfaced — never the gate string verbatim)
 *     - session ids (private workspace identifiers)
 *     - from/to/arc on traverse events (structural only, not surfaced in the snapshot)
 *     - any free-text fields (e.g. a hypothetical "body", "text", "prompt" field)
 *   Both `ax` and `metrics` are read by closed numeric allowlist (AX_NUMERIC_KEYS /
 *   TREND_SERIES) with a finite-number guard — never spread verbatim.
